I am passionate about solving customer pain points using software.

I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a major in Computer Engineering and a minor in Technopreneurship. I started out as a front-end engineer and a couple of years of back, I made a conscious switch to the back-end to become a well-rounded full-stack engineer. I have experience working for a start-up, an SME and a massive MNC and across IoT, Real-Estate, and financial services industries.

In my current job at JPMorgan, I work for the Cloud team working on one of the largest private cloud infrastructures in the world. In November 2020, I obtained the CKAD certification.

Lately, I have found immense satisfaction from evaluating and implementing scalable architectures. I have presented my evaluations to different types of audiences including senior management, lead architects, and fellow engineers while tweaking the content to be suitable for each audience.

I am passionate about communication and I'm one of the rare engineers that like to write technical documentation and incident post-mortems.

I was chosen as an SME for Front-end for one of JPMC's code for social cause programs and was asked to be a mentor for graduate students working on innovative solutions using technology to solve challenging problems.

My preferred mode of contact is email: raghavramesh94@gmail.com
