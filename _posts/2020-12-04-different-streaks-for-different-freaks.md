I'm glad I found a way to trick my brain into developing a useful habit: I've been learning French (mostly, and a few other languages) on Duolingo for the past 500 or so days for at least 5 mins every day.

The journey so far has been rewarding. It started out as an activity my wife and I would do together. Over time I developed genuine interest towards the language and I ventured into learning about the French culture through TV shows, podcasts and travel videos.

On days when I was not motivated to learn, this streak stat and my discipline kept me going. On other days,
I find myself glued to my phone finishing lesson after lesson on Duolingo, soaking in the benefits of [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

A week or so back, Duolingo rolled out the ["Hearts" feature](https://support.duolingo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002887326-What-are-Hearts-),
which [ruffled some feathers](https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/43960293) and caused many to leave the platform.
_"You can lose Hearts by answering incorrectly too many times, which has been encouraging users to pay closer attention to what they are answering before hitting “check.”_ While the amount of _XP_ I gained took a nosedive since this feature was rolled out, I am beginning to the see the positives behind it which is to ensure I don't go on auto-pilot during the few minutes I spend on the platform, learning. I'm looking forward to improving the pace at which I pick up the language with this new feature, by focusing on correctness. Perhaps it may even soon motivate me to attend the local French meetup scene for some practical experience.
