title: "Talk: Drawing faster diagrams with PlantUML"

Having used PlantUML frequently over the last 5 years, I don't hesitate to spread the word about this amazing tool. I recently gave a talk in JPMorgan Singapore. The following's the written version of it.

Let me talk about the problem it solves: when we use diagram tools like Microsoft Visio, Gliffy or Excalidraw, we have to layout every single box and manually connect their vertices with arrows by ourselves. Say we have an architecture diagram for our software and halfway through our product life cycle, we will have ourselves a decently complex diagram. Then comes a change in product direction and we may need to remove a component. What does that look like? We have to delete that component, re-draw all the arrows, and if you’re like me and you’re pedantic about the number of tiny-little grid squares that each box is supposed to occupy - it can become a very time consuming and tedious process to make sure everything looks nice.

That’s where PlantUML comes in. It’s an open-source tool that converts plain text markup into diagrams. It takes care of drawing and the layout for you. You don’t need to be a full-time engineer to create these diagrams. Most of the text you write would be the content you see on the diagram itself, which you would have had to do if you chose another tool anyway.

To be fair, the tool doesn’t give out the best first impression. The color choices, the website design, and their online demo server look archaic. But I urge you to give it five minutes because the tool is highly customizable (colors included) and supports a plethora of diagram types.

I use the tool the most to draw sequence diagrams. Sequence diagrams are used to depict relationships between components in your architecture.

The following is an example of a simple sequence diagram. Say you want to display past orders on an e-commerce website.

```
@startuml
!define LIGHTGREEN
!includeurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drakemor/RedDress-PlantUML/master/style.puml

actor User as U
entity Browser as B
control API as A
database Database as D

autoactivate on
autonumber

title "E-Commerce website: display user's past orders"

U -> B: fetch orders
B -> A: GET /orders
A -> D: _sql query_
D --> A: return resultset
A --> B: return orders
B --> U: display orders
@enduml
```
The above text generates the following diagram.

Shout out to [@Drakemor](https://github.com/Drakemor) for this pleasant palette. It speaks to PlantUML's style customizability.

To find out about other sequence diagram features or about other diagram types, you don't need to look any further than the comprehensive documentation of the [official website](http://www.plantuml.com). But these two resources also serve as excellent sources of inspiration: [PlantText](https://www.planttext.com) and [Real World PlantUML](https://real-world-plantuml.com). All the above resources provide real-world templates which are a great way to kick-start your own diagrams.

Once you get proficient with this tool, another use case I can think of and I'm personally planning to try out, is to give educational presentations starting with a blank slate. With remote work becoming the norm, there's a need for a good replacement for physical whiteboards. The existing drawing tools, for the reasons mentioned above, just don't work for me. I'm looking forward to trying out PlantUML for some solution engineering whiteboarding sessions.
