Having married a [Vaishnavite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaishnavism), I wanted to learn about the 108 Divyadesams or the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the works of [Alvars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvars). Each temple has a story behind it and it's well captured in this [informative YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhrdHlkOIj-XbEfcuP21IV4zdoX8ACbC8) by Velukkudi Krishnan.

I thought I'd take it a step further by visualizing the temples on a map as a mini side-project.
Around the same time, I was brushing up my [Docker skills](https://raghavramesh.github.io/mooc-notes/DevOps/Docker/) and I came across the [project page hosting](https://pages.github.com/) in Github Pages. It was also a 3 years since I worked on a front-end project involving a map: the last time I was when I was working at G Element to visualize the HDB buildings as polygons on a 2D map of Singapore. And this project was a neat way for me use all the above three technologies.

The MVP is here: [108 Divyadesams](https://raghavramesh.github.io/108-divyadesams/) and [here is the Github project](https://github.com/RaghavRamesh/108-divyadesams/) if you're keen to check out the code. I've captured [the roadmap](https://github.com/RaghavRamesh/108-divyadesams/projects/1) for my own reference or for those keen on contributing.
