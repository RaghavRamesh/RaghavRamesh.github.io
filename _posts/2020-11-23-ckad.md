I'm officially a [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)](https://github.com/RaghavRamesh/mooc-notes/blob/master/Certificates/CKAD.pdf).

A few months back I was skeptical about pursuing certifications because I heard a bunch of people saying, "certificate is just a piece of paper, it's the real experience that counts". But I pursued this specific certification anyway because:
- it gave me a structured learning path for a decently complex technology
- it validates my understanding of the technology and that the way I am using Kubernetes and its patterns are correct
- from a career progression or recruitment perspective, it shows thirst for knowledge
- it gave me the motivation to learn aspects of K8s that are not needed for the current apps I manage but those that will come handy in the future
- and for the following reasons that Gourav has captured well in [his Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Kubernetes-certification-worth-it/answer/Gourav-Shah):
  - "Demand and Supply: Since kubernetes has already become the new platform, there is a huge demand for people who can implement solutions with Kubernetes right now, and is going to remain so for next few years."
  - "Complexity: Being able to use kubernetes the right way still remains complex. It has a steep learning curve."
  - "Difficulty of the Exam: Till date CKA exam conducted by CNCF, remains moderately difficult. It's practice oriented and not theoretical. People pass the exams with multiple attempts."
