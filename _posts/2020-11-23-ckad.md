A few months back I was skeptical about pursuing certifications after I read the piece on [certification may not imply competence](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CertificationCompetenceCorrelation.html) by Martin Fowler. But I pursued this specific certification anyway because:
- it gave me a structured and time-boxed learning path for a complex technology with many topics to cover
- it validates my understanding of the technology and that the way I am using Kubernetes and its patterns are correct
- it gave me the motivation to learn aspects of Kubernetes that are not needed for the current apps I manage but those that will come handy in the future
- from a recruitment perspective, it's an effective way for non-technical recruiters to filter for candidates based on their requirements
- till date (Dec 2020), the CKAD exam conducted by CNCF, remains moderately difficult and hence its reputation is intact. The exam is focuses on real-world scenarios and people pass the exams with multiple attempts.

I'm officially a Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)!
