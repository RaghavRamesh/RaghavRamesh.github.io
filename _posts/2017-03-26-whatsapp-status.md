I wouldn't consider this a typical post on my blog, it's more of a rant about an update in a software I use everyday. But I'll leave this post here until I find time to organise my blog into different sections.

One of WhatsApp's latest feature 'Status' is a great space for free ads and marketing for the near future.

Almost everyone who has updated to the latest WhatsApp click on their friends' statuses without being asked to - they do it out of curiosity.

The reach is better than even Facebook because the news feed doesn't show the posts of all friends. But WhatsApp has no such filtering, the reach = all those who have your number stored in their contacts (which is probably huge for a regular WhatsApp user).
It's better than Snapchat too because your friends list on Snapchat will be a much smaller list than on WhatsApp because WhatsApp's contacts =  all contacts stored in your phone. On Snapchat, an avg user will only add those he/she would want to share their Snap stories with.

Although it's quite evil that I have to enable 'Read receipts' (blue ticks) to see who have viewed my status. I don't like this because of the way I treat my WhatsApp conversations - I treat them as async messages which I'd like to respond to later (I've discussed the benefits of async messaging in this [post](/blog/2016/11/21/instant-messaging-at-work.html). I try explaining my need to remove the appearance of blue ticks to my friends and most of them understand. But now that I've enabled them, it leaves a bad taste when you read a message and not respond immediately as it makes the sender feel unimportant. I hope WhatsApp releases an update soon to remove the need enable this option in order to check Status views.
